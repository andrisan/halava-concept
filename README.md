## Overview

**Halava** is a two-sided halal commerce platform designed to be the default destination for anything halal:

- **Buy** halal groceries, ingredients, and products (B2C marketplace)
- **Find** halal restaurants and places while traveling (directory + discovery)
- **Operate** halal businesses through modular merchant capabilities (online + in-store)

The platform uses a **capability-based model** where merchants progressively enable features (POS, online selling, restaurant operations) as their business grows—no forced business type selection upfront.
