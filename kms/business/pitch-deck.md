## Slide 1 — Title
**Halava**  
*A consumer-first halal commerce platform*

- One-line tagline: "Halal, Available Anywhere"

## Slide 2 — The Problem

**Halal commerce today is fragmented and inefficient**

**Consumers:**
- Hard to discover trusted halal products in unfamiliar cities
- High delivery fees for small orders
- No coordination tools for group purchases
- Lack of price comparison across merchants

**Merchants:**
- Miss out on diaspora demand
- Fragmented logistics workflow
- Can't coordinate group purchases
- No unified order + inventory + POS system

---

## Slide 3 — The Insight

**Halal commerce needs consumer-led discovery and merchant-centric operations**

> Build value for consumers first. Let consumer demand pull merchants in.

This problem is global, but the value proposition adapts:
- **Muslim-minority markets:** Lead with halal trust + discovery
- **Muslim-majority markets:** Lead with consumer-centric utility tools
