# Halava Pitch Deck Outline (17 Slides)

> **Last updated:** February 2026
> **Purpose:** Investor-ready, partner-friendly presentation

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**Halava**
*A consumer-first halal commerce platform*

- One-line tagline: "Halal, Available Anywhere"

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem

**Halal commerce today is fragmented and inefficient**

**Consumers:**
- Hard to discover trusted halal products in unfamiliar cities
- High delivery fees for small orders
- No coordination tools for group purchases
- No way to track purchase history or budget halal spending across merchants

**Merchants:**
- Miss out on diaspora demand
- Managing orders across channels is manual and error-prone
- Lose sales when delivery costs are prohibitive for individual orders
- No unified order + inventory + POS system

---

## Slide 3 — The Insight

**Halal commerce needs consumer-led discovery and merchant-centric operations**

> Build value for consumers first. Let consumer demand pull merchants in.

This problem is global, but the value proposition adapts:
- **Muslim-minority markets:** Lead with halal trust + discovery
- **Muslim-majority markets:** Lead with consumer-centric utility tools

---

## Slide 4 — Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**TAM (Global):** Multi-trillion dollar halal industry, 1.8B+ Muslims, halal e-commerce penetration very low

**SAM (Multi-tier approach):**
- **Tier 1 (Muslim-minority):** Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, UK, USA — tens of billions (high willingness to pay for trust)
- **Tier 2 (Muslim-majority):** Indonesia, Malaysia, UAE, Pakistan — hundreds of billions (massive volume)

**SOM (Japan launch):**
- 230,689 Indonesian nationals (37.2% YoY growth) + 100k other Muslims
- At ¥10,000/month × 5% adoption = **¥115M monthly GMV** → **¥5.77M monthly fee revenue**
- Japan expansion: Indonesian → other SEA → South Asian → other residents → tourists

**Strategic expansion roadmap:**
1. Year 1–3: Japan (prove model, B2B network traction)
2. Year 4–7: Taiwan, South Korea (Tier 1 — similar diaspora communities)
3. Year 7–9: Singapore, UK, France, Germany, USA, Canada (Tier 1 — established markets)
4. Year 9–12: Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, UAE (Tier 2 — massive volume)
5. Year 12+: Turkey, Egypt, rest of Middle East (global coverage)

## Slide 7 — Competitive Landscape

| Feature | Halava | BASE/STORES | Shopify | UberEats |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Halal-focused | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Transaction fees | 2.5–5% | 3.6%+¥40 | 3.25–3.9% | 30–35% |
| Subscription | ¥0–18k (waivable) | Free–¥2k | ¥3.6k–46k | N/A |
| Unified POS + online | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Offline-capable POS | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Group purchase | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Consumer expense tracking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-language (EN/JP/ID) | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

**Key advantage:** Only platform combining halal trust + low fees + consumer financial tools

---

## Slide 8 — Go-To-Market

**Merchant acquisition (low CAC):**
- B2B halal supplier network — warm introductions
- In-store promotion kits (QR posters, counter displays)
- Assisted onboarding with dedicated support
- Early Adopter Program incentives

**Consumer acquisition (viral-first):**
- Group purchase sharing — forced virality through cost-splitting
- In-store QR exposure — every merchant becomes acquisition channel
- SEO for halal discovery queries
- Paid marketing only after retention is proven

**Flywheel effect:**
```
More consumers → More merchant demand → More listings → Better discovery → More consumers
```

---

## Slide 9 — Monetization Philosophy

Two revenue streams:
1. **Transaction fees** (70–80% at maturity) — scale with GMV
2. **Membership plans** (20–30%) — waived if transaction fees exceed plan fee

---

## Slide 10 — Transaction Fees

**Phase 1 (MVP) — Honor-based**

| Monthly GMV | Transaction Fee |
|------------|-----------------|
| ¥0–300k | 2.0% |
| ¥300k–1M | 1.8% |
| ¥1M–3M | 1.6% |
| ¥3M+ | 1.4% |

**Phase 2+ — With Payment Provider**

| Monthly GMV | Transaction Fee |
|------------|-----------------|
| ¥0–300k | 5.0% |
| ¥300k–1M | 4.5% |
| ¥1M–3M | 4.0% |
| ¥3M–10M | 3.0% |
| ¥10M+ | 2.5% |

**Rate application:** Marginal rates (no cliff effects)

---

## Slide 11 — Membership Plans

| Plan | Monthly Fee | POS Quota |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Free** | ¥0 | 300 txns |
| **Growth** | ¥6,000 (¥3,000)* | 3,000 txns |
| **Pro** | ¥18,000 (¥9,000)* | Unlimited |

*Phase 1 early adopter price (50% off, 5-year lock-in)

**Automatic Waiver Coupon:**

When your transaction fees reach the membership threshold, a coupon is automatically applied to waive your membership fee.

| Plan | Threshold to Unlock Waiver |
|------|---------------------------|
| Growth | ¥6,000 in transaction fees (¥120k GMV) |
| Pro | ¥18,000 in transaction fees (¥360k GMV) |

**Example by plan and sales volume:**

| Scenario | Plan | Monthly GMV | Trx Fee (5%) | Membership | Coupon | You Pay |
|----------|------|-------------|--------------|------------|--------|---------|
| Low sales | Free | ¥50,000 | ¥2,500 | ¥0 | — | **¥2,500** |
| Low sales | Growth | ¥50,000 | ¥2,500 | ¥6,000 | — | ¥8,500 |
| At threshold | Growth | ¥120,000 | ¥6,000 | ¥6,000 | -¥6,000 | **¥6,000** |
| High sales | Growth | ¥200,000 | ¥10,000 | ¥6,000 | -¥6,000 | **¥10,000** |

**Key insight:** Low-sales merchant on Free = ¥2,500. Same merchant on Growth = ¥8,500. Only upgrade for POS quota/features.

**What this means for you:**
- Sell enough to hit the threshold → membership fee waived
- Coupon applied automatically on your monthly bill
- The more you sell, the better the deal

**Why this is fair:**
- **Free plan exists** for low-volume merchants (pay trx fees only)
- **Upgrade for features**, not volume — POS quota, staff accounts, analytics
- **Waiver coupon is a bonus** for high performers, not an entitlement
- Low GMV + paid plan = paying for features you need, not a penalty

## Slide 17 — Why Now, Why Us

**Why now:**
- Indonesian diaspora in Japan growing 37% YoY
- Halal e-commerce penetration <2% — massive whitespace
- COVID accelerated digital adoption among small merchants
- No incumbent focused on halal-specific commerce

**Existing behavior, better tools:**
- Indonesians already coordinate group purchases via WhatsApp/LINE groups
- Current process: scattered chats, manual calculations, trust-based reimbursement
- Halava formalizes this into a proper platform with automatic splitting, tracking, and receipts
- We're not changing behavior — we're making existing behavior easier

**Why us:**
- Deep understanding of Indonesian Muslim community in Japan
- Technical capability to build consumer + merchant platform
- B2B network access for merchant acquisition
- First-hand experience with the group purchase pain point
