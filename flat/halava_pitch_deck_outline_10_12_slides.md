## Slide 1 — Title
**Halava**  
*A consumer-first halal commerce platform*

- One-line tagline:  
  "Halal, Available Anywhere"
- Your name & role
- Date / version

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem
**Halal commerce today is fragmented and inefficient**

**The pain is most acute for diaspora communities** (students, workers, immigrants):

- Consumers:
  - Hard to discover trusted halal products & shops in unfamiliar cities (back home, every supermarket has halal food)
  - Must order online with high delivery fees — or meet minimum order thresholds for free delivery
  - No way to coordinate with friends to pool orders, split costs, and meet thresholds
  - Price-sensitive but lack tools to compare prices across merchants
  - Existing e-commerce platforms are generic (don't understand halal needs)

- Merchants:
  - Miss out on diaspora demand (limited online presence to reach price-sensitive diaspora customers looking for halal)
  - Fragmented logistics workflow (manage shipments manually via Kuroneko/Yubin; OR use delivery platforms and pay 30-35% commission)
  - Can't coordinate group purchases or bulk orders — shipping is per-order, no incentive structure for larger orders
  - No unified order + inventory + POS system (orders managed offline via email/phone, shipments via courier, in-store sales via cash; no shared visibility)

---

## Slide 3 — The Insight
**Halal commerce needs consumer-led discovery and merchant-centric operations**

- Build value for consumers first
- Let consumer demand pull merchants in
- Help merchants grow with modular capabilities to best serve their customers

**This problem is global, but the value proposition adapts:**
- 1.8B+ Muslims worldwide + health-conscious consumers
- Halal commerce is fragmented in **every** market (Japan, SEA, Europe, North America, Middle East)
- Merchants sell via scattered channels (website, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.) with no halal-specific discovery layer; new diaspora (fresh arrivals, visitors) can't find them
- Existing platforms are either generic (Amazon, Shopee) or lack halal-specific features and merchant discovery

**Two-tier positioning:**
- **Muslim-minority markets:** Lead with halal trust + discovery (acute pain point)
- **Muslim-majority markets:** Lead with consumer-centric utility tools (halal is assumed, convenience matters)

Key insight:
> If consumers love the platform, merchants will follow. This dynamic works **everywhere** — we just emphasize different features per market.

---

## Slide 4 — Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
**A massive, globally underserved market**

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market — Global):**
  - Global halal market: **multi-trillion dollar** industry (food, cosmetics, lifestyle)
  - One of the fastest-growing consumer segments globally
  - **1.8+ billion Muslims worldwide** + health-conscious consumers
  - Halal e-commerce penetration remains very low (massive opportunity)

- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market — Multi-tier approach):**
  
  **Tier 1 — Muslim-minority markets (halal trust is primary pain):**
  - **East Asia:** Japan, South Korea, Taiwan — growing Muslim tourism + diaspora
  - **Singapore:** Multicultural, wealthy, English-speaking hub
  - **Europe:** UK, France, Germany — large established Muslim populations
  - **North America:** USA, Canada — diaspora + halal-curious consumers
  - Combined: **tens of billions** in halal commerce (high willingness to pay for trust)
  
  **Tier 2 — Muslim-majority markets (merchant tools + group purchase primary value):**
  - **Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh:** 600M+ Muslims, rapidly growing e-commerce
  - **Malaysia:** High GDP/capita, halal hub for SEA
  - **Egypt, Turkey, Middle East:** Large populations, cross-border commerce
  - **GCC (UAE, Saudi Arabia):** Wealthy, tech-savvy consumers
  - Combined: **hundreds of billions** in halal commerce (massive volume, lower fees acceptable)

- **SOM (Initial Launch — Japan):**
  - **Why Japan first:** Established B2B halal supplier network, regulatory clarity, halal trust is acute pain
  - Stage 1 (Validation): 5–10 pilot merchants via B2B network
  - Stage 2 (Traction): 15–25 active merchants, ¥5M+ monthly GMV
  - Stage 3 (Commitment): 50+ merchants, ¥10M+ monthly GMV, national expansion ready

**Strategic expansion roadmap:**
1. **Prove model** (Year 1–3): Japan only — establish product-market fit, B2B network traction, regulatory pathway
2. **Tier 1 expansion** (Year 4–7): Taiwan, South Korea — geographic proximity, large Southeast Asian worker populations, similar regulatory environment
3. **Remaining Tier 1 markets** (Year 7–9): Singapore, UK, France, Germany, USA, Canada — bridge positioning; strong halal infrastructure and diaspora communities
4. **Tier 2 expansion** (Year 9–12): Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, UAE — Muslim-majority markets; adapt to group purchase + merchant tools, massive volume
5. **Global coverage** (Year 12+): Turkey, Egypt, rest of Middle East — platform effects at scale

---

## Slide 5 — The Solution (Halava)
**A two-sided halal commerce platform designed for trust, utility, and coordination**

**Consumer app (market-adaptive):**
- **Halal discovery & trust** — geo-based directory, certified vs. merchant-declared (primary: Muslim-minority markets)
- **Group purchase coordination** — invite friends, pool orders, share delivery (primary: all markets, especially Muslim-majority)
- Online marketplace with product browsing & checkout
- Unified purchase history (online + POS-linked in-store)
- Price comparison across merchants and time
- Reviews, ratings, saved items

**Merchant platform (capability-based):**
- Directory listing — start here, no business type required
- Enable capabilities as you grow: Shop (online selling), POS (in-store transactions), Restaurant Ops (menus, reservations)
- Shared product catalog across online + POS
- Order management dashboard (online + in-store)
- Inventory sync and low-stock alerts
- Receipt generation and customer linking (QR or claim code)
- Basic promotions and featured listings

**Offline–online bridge:**
- QR code linking for in-store purchases → consumer history
- In-store promotion kits (counter displays, posters) drive QR adoption
- POS works offline; syncs when network available

---

## Slide 6 — Product Differentiation
**Why Halava is different**

**Merchant-first design:**
- Capability-based model (not "shop vs. restaurant") — start with directory, enable POS + online as you grow
- No business-type lock-in; merchants can pivot (hybrid businesses supported)
- POS + online unified from day one (shared inventory across channels)
- Offline-capable POS (works without internet; syncs when available)

**Consumer-first value:**
- **Forced virality:** Group purchase as first-class feature — invite friends, coordinate, pool orders (drives app engagement)
- Geo-based halal trust directory (not generic marketplace)
- Unified purchase history (online + POS) unlocks price comparison & loyalty
- Offline-to-online bridge: In-store QR → purchase history → app retention

**This is coordination infrastructure, not just e-commerce.**

**Competitive advantages:**
- **Muslim-minority markets (Japan, UK, Singapore):** Only Halava combines halal trust + unified POS+online + geo-discovery. Beats generic platforms (Rakuten, Amazon)
- **Muslim-majority markets (Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia):** Group purchase + low fees (2.5–5%) beats Shopee/Tokopedia/Lazada (5–15%). Offline-online bridge serves cash-only merchants

---

## Slide 7 — Competitive Landscape
**How Halava compares**

| Feature | Halava | BASE/STORES | Rakuten | UberEats/Wolt | Halal-specific apps |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|---------------------| 
| Halal-focused | ✅ Primary | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Limited |
| Low merchant fees | ✅ 2.5–5% gradual | ✅ 3.6–5% | ❌ 5–15% | ❌ 30–35% | Varies (opaque) |
| Unified POS + online | ✅ Shared inventory | ⚠️ Separate | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ |
| Group purchase | ✅ First-class | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| In-store linking | ✅ QR + receipts | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Offline-capable POS | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Consumer discovery | ✅ Geo + trust | ❌ | ✅ Generic | ✅ Generic | ⚠️ Directory only |
| Merchant onboarding | ✅ Capability-based | ⚠️ Complex | ⚠️ Complex | ⚠️ High fees | ⚠️ Limited |

**Key differentiator:** Only Halava combines all differentiators in one platform. Merchants don't choose business type upfront; capabilities enable flexibility. This uniqueness translates directly into value across both Muslim-minority and Muslim-majority markets.

---

## Slide 8 — Go-To-Market (GTM)
**How Halava grows (consumer-first + merchant-pull)**

**Merchant acquisition (top-down):**
- Existing **B2B halal supplier network** (established relationships)
- Trust-based, assisted onboarding (not self-serve; personal touch)
- In-store promotion kits (QR posters, counter displays) bundled with signup
- Low onboarding friction (capability-based, no forced decisions)

**Consumer acquisition (bottom-up + viral):**
- **Group purchase sharing** (forced virality: invite friends to coordinate)
  - Each group invite is a discovery & join event for new users
  - Email/SMS-based (low friction, no app required to join)
- **In-store QR exposure** (offline-to-online loop)
  - Customers see QR at cashier ⇒ scan to link purchase ⇒ see price history + group purchase feature
  - Merchants benefit from increased repeat visits + app engagement
- **SEO & utility** ("halal restaurants near me", price comparison, group buy)
  - Community-driven content (reviews, ratings)

**Early stage:** Consumer acquisition is organic (group purchase + in-store QR). Paid marketing **introduced only after retention & repeat purchase are proven**.

**Revenue focus:** Transaction fees scale with success; marketing ROI is validated before spend.

---

## Slide 9 — Monetization Philosophy
**Simple, fair, and scalable**

Two cleanly separated revenue streams:

1. **Transaction fees** — monetize volume and success (70–80% of revenue at maturity)
   - Scale with GMV; no caps; gradual tiers; no paywalls on core functionality
   - Merchants never punished for growth

2. **Membership plans** — monetize features and operational value (20–30% at maturity)
   - Advanced promotions, analytics, staff tools, POS quota
   - **Monthly fee waived if transaction fees ≥ plan fee** (no wasted subscriptions)
   - Optional; not required to sell online

**Key principle & unit economics:**
> Monetize success, not participation. CAC ~¥50k, breakeven at ~¥1M GMV (2–3 months), LTV/CAC >2:1 by month 6.

---

## Slide 10 — Transaction Fees (Gradual Pricing)
**Fees decrease smoothly as merchants grow — no cliffs**

**Online marketplace orders** (all merchants, regardless of plan):

*Phase 1 (MVP):* Lower rates (2.0%–1.4%) — merchants verify payments manually via bank transfer.
*Phase 2+:* Rates below — Halava intermediates payments, providing more value.

| Monthly GMV | Transaction Fee |
| ¥0–300k | 5.0% |
| ¥300k–1M | 4.5% |
| ¥1M–3M | 4.0% |
| ¥3M–10M | 3.0% |
| ¥10M+ | 2.5% (negotiable) |

**Rate application:** Marginal rates (tax-bracket style) — each tier's rate applies only to GMV within that tier, eliminating cliff effects.

**Example:** A merchant with ¥500k monthly GMV pays:
- 5.0% × ¥300k = ¥15,000
- 4.5% × ¥200k = ¥9,000
- **Total: ¥24,000** (not 4.5% × ¥500k)

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Collected honor-based via monthly invoicing (off-platform settlement).
**Phase 2+:** Automatically deducted at source via payment provider (e.g., Stripe Connect).

**Key properties:**
- No free transactions
- No hard cliffs (growth always rewarded)
- Platform revenue scales with merchant success
- Transparent, predictable billing

---

## Slide 11 — Membership Plans (Features + POS Quota)
**Optional subscriptions for features; do not affect transaction fees**

| Plan | Monthly Fee | POS Quota | Key Features |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Free** | ¥0 | 300 txns | Unlimited products, online selling, basic dashboard |
| **Growth** | ¥6,000 (¥3,000)* | 3,000 txns | Advanced promotions, group rules, customer insights, priority support |
| **Pro** | ¥18,000 (¥9,000)* | Unlimited | Analytics & trends, inventory tools, multi-staff, free promo kits |
| **Enterprise** | Negotiated | Unlimited | Custom features, integrations, dedicated account manager |

*Phase 1 early adopter price in parentheses (50% off, locked in for 5 years). Waived if monthly transaction fees ≥ plan fee.

**POS transaction top-ups** (when quota exhausted):
- Small: 100 txns / ¥300
- Medium: 300 txns / ¥750
- Large: 500 txns / ¥1,000

**Top-up rules:**
- Expire at month-end (no rollover)
- 5-transaction grace buffer auto-billed at ¥75 (discourages reliance)
- Auto-purchase available (trigger at 80% quota)

**Upgrade incentive:** Merchants consistently needing 1,500+ POS txns/month are better off upgrading to Growth (¥3,000) than buying top-ups.

---

## Slide 12 — Fee Waiver Logic & Sample Merchant Invoice
**No wasted subscriptions; fair and transparent**

**Monthly billing logic:**
```
Merchant pays = MAX(
  membership_fee,
  transaction_fees_for_month
)
```

**Example invoice (Growth Plan):**
```
Monthly Invoice — January 2026
────────────────────────────────
Plan: Growth (¥3,000/mo)
Online GMV: ¥450,000

Transaction fees:
  ¥0–¥300k   @ 5.0%  = ¥15,000
  ¥300k–¥450k @ 4.5% = ¥6,750
  Total transaction fees: ¥21,750

Membership fee: ¥3,000
Waiver applied: ✓ 
(transaction fees exceed membership fee)

Amount due: ¥21,750
────────────────────────────────
```

**Transparency principles:**
- Always show both membership + transaction fees (even when waived)
- Explicitly label waivers so merchants see the value
- Never opaque bundling

**Benefit:** High-sales months feel "free"; low-sales months are predictable. Fair for merchants, safe revenue for platform.

## Slide 13 — Traction & Validation
**Early signals of product-market fit**

> **Data source:** See `halava_market_validation.md` for detailed metrics tracking and research methodology.

- **Merchants:** [X] pilot merchants, [Y] LOIs from B2B halal supplier network
  - *Track in: Market Validation doc → Section 3.1 (Pilot Merchant Tracking)*
- **Consumers:** [Z] registered users in beta, [W] group purchases initiated
  - *Track in: Market Validation doc → Section 3.2 (Consumer Beta Metrics)*
- **GMV:** [Amount] in test transactions (Phase 1: honor-based settlement)
  - *Track in: Market Validation doc → Section 3.3 (GMV Tracking Methodology)*
- **Key partnerships:** Established B2B halal supplier network relationships
- **Feedback highlights:**
  - "Finally, a platform that understands halal needs" — Muslim consumer
  - "Group purchase feature is exactly what our community wanted" — Halal shop owner
  - "Low fees and integrated POS make this a no-brainer" — Merchant

**Product Roadmap (Payment Phases):**
- Phase 1 (MVP): Discover + Shop + POS (off-platform settlement)
- Phase 2: Payment provider integration (Stripe/PAY.JP) + Restaurant Ops
- Phase 3: Direct payment intermediation (資金移動業 license — 3–5+ years)

*Note: Payment Phases are distinct from Funding Stages (see Slide 15). Stage 2 funding enables Phase 2 payment integration.*

*Note: Update placeholder metrics [X], [Y], [Z], [W], [Amount] with actual data from `halava_market_validation.md` as validation progresses.*

---

## Slide 15 — The Ask (Stage 1 — Validation)
**Capital & milestones for Japan launch → global expansion**

- **Raising:** ¥3M / ~$20K USD (Stage 1)
- **Post-money valuation:** ¥30M / ~$200K USD (implied)
- **Equity:** Operating Founder 90%, Co-founder 10% (post-Stage 1)

**Use of funds:**
- ¥1.5M: Operating Founder compensation (part-time contractor, 7 months)
- ¥800k: Cloud infrastructure, development tools, SaaS subscriptions
- ¥500k: In-store promotion kits (QR posters, counter displays)
- ¥200k: Legal setup & compliance (Japan 株式会社 formation)

**Milestones (7-month runway — Japan launch):**
- MVP live (transaction flow: product discovery → order → POS/online fulfillment)
- 5–10 pilot merchants onboarded via B2B network
- Honor-based transaction fee collection validated
- Clear path to Stage 2 (payment provider integration)

**Future stages (aligned with monetization strategy):**
- **Stage 2 (¥5M):** 15–25 active merchants, ¥5M+ monthly GMV, payment provider integration prep
- **Stage 3 (¥7M):** 50+ merchants, ¥10M+ monthly GMV, Phase 2 payment provider live

**Total capital plan:** ¥15M (~$100K) across 3 bootstrap stages (see monetization doc section 9.1 for full staging details).

---

## Slide 16 — Financial Model Strength
**Dual revenue streams = resilient, scalable unit economics**

**Why this model works:**
- **No paywalls on monetization:** Merchants can sell & make money without paying upfront
- **Aligned incentives:** Platform revenue grows only when merchants succeed
- **Predictability:** Merchants know fee structure before signup; no surprise charges
- **Sustainability:** Profitable at modest GMV levels; scales indefinitely

**Capital efficiency:**
- Stage 1 (¥3M): 5–10 pilot merchants, MVP proven
- Stage 2 (¥5M): 15–25 merchants, ¥5M+ monthly GMV, traction proven
- Stage 3 (¥7M): 50+ merchants, ¥10M+ monthly GMV, payment provider live

**Profitability:** Operational break-even at ~¥500M annual GMV with current pricing, enabling sustainable growth.

---

## Slide 17 — Vision & Next Steps
**Building the global halal commerce infrastructure**

**Vision:** Halava becomes the **default platform for halal commerce worldwide** — wherever you are, if it's halal, it's on Halava.

**Expansion sequencing** (detailed rationale in Slide 4):

**Year 1–3 — Prove model (Japan):** Establish product-market fit, B2B network traction, regulatory clarity

**Year 4–7 — Tier 1 expansion (Taiwan, South Korea):** Geographic proximity, large Southeast Asian worker populations, similar regulatory environment

**Year 7–9 — Remaining Tier 1 (Singapore, UK, France, Germany, USA, Canada):** Strong halal infrastructure, diaspora communities, bridge to Tier 2

**Year 9–12 — Tier 2 scale (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, UAE):** Muslim-majority markets, massive volume; adapted pitch emphasizes group buying + merchant tools over halal discovery

**Year 12+ — Global coverage (Turkey, Egypt, rest of Middle East):** Platform effects at scale; cross-border coordination, global merchant network

**Capital-efficient model:** Same platform, different market emphasis.
