# Halava Pitch Deck Outline (10–15 Slides)

> **Last updated:** January 2026  
> **Purpose:** Investor-ready, partner-friendly presentation

This outline is designed to be **investor-ready**, **partner-friendly**, and directly aligned with the current Halava application specification and monetization strategy.

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**Halava**  
*A consumer-first halal commerce platform*

- One-line tagline:  
  "Discover, buy, and coordinate halal products — online and offline."
- Your name & role
- Date / version

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem
**Halal commerce today is fragmented and inefficient**

- Consumers:
  - Hard to discover trusted halal products & shops
  - No tools for coordination (group buying, shared delivery)
  - Existing e-commerce platforms are generic

- Merchants:
  - Limited digital presence
  - High commissions on delivery platforms
  - No access to demand signals or customer insights

---

## Slide 3 — The Insight
**Halal commerce needs a consumer-first platform, not a merchant-first marketplace**

- Build value for consumers first
- Let consumer demand pull merchants in
- Monetize only after value is proven

Key insight:
> If consumers love the platform, merchants will follow.

---

## Slide 4 — Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
**A large and underserved market**

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
  - Global halal market: $2.5 trillion+ (food, cosmetics, lifestyle)
  - Growing 6–8% annually

- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):**
  - Japan halal commerce: ~¥200–300 billion
  - ~200,000 Muslims in Japan + 40M+ annual Muslim tourists (pre-pandemic)
  - Growing interest from health-conscious non-Muslim Japanese consumers

- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
  - Initial focus: Tokyo, Osaka, major cities
  - Year 1–3 target: 500–1,000 merchants, ¥500M–¥1B GMV

*Note: Customize these figures based on updated market research.*

---

## Slide 5 — The Solution (Halava)
**A two-sided halal commerce platform designed for trust, utility, and coordination**

- Consumer app:
  - Discovery & trust
  - Group purchase coordination
  - Seamless sharing

- Merchant platform:
  - Online & group sales
  - Operational efficiency
  - Offline–online bridge (QR, promotion kits)

## Slide 6 — Product Differentiation
**Why Halava is different**

- Offline touchpoints drive online adoption

This is not just e-commerce — it's **coordination infrastructure**.

---

## Slide 7 — Competitive Landscape
**How Halava compares**

| | Halava | BASE/STORES | Rakuten | UberEats/Wolt | Halal-specific apps |
|---|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Halal-focused | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## Slide 8 — Go-To-Market (GTM)
**How Halava grows**

- Merchant acquisition:
  - Existing B2B halal supplier network
  - Trust-based onboarding

- Consumer acquisition:
  - Group purchase sharing
  - In-store QR exposure
  - SEO & utility-driven discovery

- Paid marketing introduced only after retention

---

## Slide 9 — Monetization Philosophy
**Simple, fair, and scalable**

- Transaction fees scale gradually with sales
- Membership plans are for features only
- No quotas, no unlock tricks
- No upside cap for the platform

Principle:
> Monetize success, not participation.

---

## Slide 10 — Transaction Fees (Gradual Pricing)
**Fees decrease smoothly as merchants grow**

Example curve (illustrative):
- ¥0–300k GMV → 5.0%
- ¥300k–1M → 4.5%
- ¥1M–3M → 4.0%
- ¥3M–10M → 3.0%
- ¥10M+ → 2.5%+

- No free zones
- No cliffs
- Growth is always rewarded

---

## Slide 11 — Membership Plans (Features Only)
**Optional subscriptions for operational value**

- Free:
  - Unlimited products
  - Online & group sales
  - Basic management

- Growth (¥3,000/month):
  - Advanced promotions
  - Group purchase controls
  - Customer insights

- Pro (¥8,000/month):
  - Advanced analytics
  - Inventory & staff tools

---

## Slide 12 — Membership Fee Waiver Logic
**No opportunity loss, no wasted subscriptions**

Monthly charge:

```
Merchant pays = max(
  membership fee,
  transaction fee for the month
)
```

- High sales month → membership fee waived
- Low sales month → predictable subscription

Fair for merchants, safe for the platform.
